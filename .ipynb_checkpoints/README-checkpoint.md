Here I'm working on different kinds of recommendation systems for the movielens data. The following recommendation systems are implemented:
1. Cosine Similarity with KNN (User-User) (User-Based Collaborative Filtering)
2. Cosine Similarity with SVD (Matrix Factorization) (Movie-User) (User-Based Collaborative Filtering)
3. Cosine Similarity with SVD (Matrix Factorization) (Movie-Movie) (Item-Based Collaborative Filtering)

These are based on https://github.com/rposhala/Recommender-System-on-MovieLens-dataset/blob/main/Recommender_System_using_SVD.ipynb

The next thing I will be investigating is Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) and Matrix Factorization (MF) for recommendation systems.
